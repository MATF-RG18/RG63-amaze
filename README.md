You are a deer stuck in a maze with monsters... you have to fight your way out.

to move around use W A S D.
Once you encounter a monster your movement is different
use J K L to dodge attacks, you can jump on I but it serves no purpose
use U to Attack them in turn

thats it, the commands are simple.

have fun
